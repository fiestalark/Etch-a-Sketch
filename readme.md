Event Listeners:

You're currently adding a new event listener to every single square
With a 100x100 grid, that's 10,000 event listeners!
Is there a more efficient way to handle mouse events for all squares?
(Hint: Look up event delegation - could you add just one listener to the container?)


Style Management:

You're setting individual style attributes for each div
Could this be handled more efficiently with CSS classes?
Could you calculate dimensions in CSS instead of JavaScript?


Button Click Handler:

You're using a while(true) loop with return
Is there a cleaner way to handle invalid inputs?
What happens if someone clicks "Cancel" on the prompt?


Grid Size:

The 960px is hardcoded
Could this be more flexible/responsive?
